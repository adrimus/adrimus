### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a system admin who loves automating tasks and making things easier. I'm passionate about powershell. I use PowerShell to manage servers, networks, and cloud resources. I also enjoy learning new technologies and sharing my knowledge with others. You can find some of my projects and scripts on my github profile. Feel free to check them out and let me know what you think. Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Docker Deep Dive
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working deploying resources with Bicep
- I want to learn [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/)
